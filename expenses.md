Burlington – Target Weekly Revenue for Operations (2026)
Purpose
Set a weekly revenue floor that ensures Burlington operations (venue, staff, refs, media, leadership, jerseys, etc.) remain stable even when revenue is “lumpy” (early birds, general payments, jersey drops).

Key Insight
In the Burlington 2026 model, expenses are recurring and fairly steady, while revenue arrives in spikes. So the safest operational benchmark is:
Weekly revenue needed to consistently cover average operating expenses (with a buffer)

Expense Baseline (from the 2026 sheet)
Across the year, monthly expenses typically land around $80k–$90k, with some months reaching ~$105k and lower months around ~$56k.
A conservative operating baseline is:
$85,000 per month (typical operating month)
Convert to weekly:
$85,000 ÷ 4.33 weeks ≈ $19,600 per week
This is the minimum required just to cover expected expenses.

Recommended Weekly Revenue Target (Ops-Safe)
To handle:
payment delays
refunds / churn
timing gaps between collections and payroll
You should maintain a buffer above the minimum expense coverage.
✅ Target Weekly Revenue Range
$22,000 – $25,000 per week
$20k/week → Bare-minimum expense coverage
$22k–$25k/week → Healthy & low-stress operations
Above this → Builds runway for slower registration periods

Notes
Strong revenue months (e.g., March/April/May) average well above this weekly floor.
The main risk is low-revenue weeks during transition periods between seasons.

Required Registrations to Hit the Weekly Target
To translate the weekly revenue target into registrations, we need to assume an average revenue per player.
From the sheet, common per-player rates include:
Early Bird: $285
General Payment: $290
Payment Plan (weekly/instalment): ~$42.71 per instalment
Because revenue is a mix of early birds, general payments, and instalments, a practical blended assumption is:
Blended Revenue per Player (weekly equivalent)
If we assume each player contributes roughly $285–$290 over a ~7-week payment cycle, then:
$285 ÷ 7 ≈ $40.70/week per player
$290 ÷ 7 ≈ $41.40/week per player
So a reasonable working range is:
~$41/week per active paying player

Registrations Needed Per Week
Using the ops-safe weekly revenue target:
1) Minimum (bare coverage)
$20,000/week ÷ $41 ≈ 488 active paying players
2) Healthy ops target
$22,000/week ÷ $41 ≈ 537 active paying players
3) Strong buffer
$25,000/week ÷ $41 ≈ 610 active paying players

Alternative View (if mostly upfront payments)
If most revenue comes from upfront Early Bird / General Payments instead of instalments:
$22,000/week ÷ $285 ≈ 77 new registrations/week
$25,000/week ÷ $285 ≈ 88 new registrations/week
This is a useful benchmark during heavy early-bird periods.

Practical Interpretation
During payment plan-heavy weeks, focus on maintaining ~540–610 active paying players.
During upfront-registration spikes, aim for ~75–90 new registrations/week to stay on track.

Next Step (Optional)
We can add:
a weekly cashflow tracker to flag weeks below $22k
a rolling 4-week buffer requirement
seasonal targets (Winter/Spring/Summer/Fall) based on actual registration cycles
